Merge Request Guidelines
------------------------

.. _merge_requests:

Before you submit a merge request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The merge request should include tests for your bugfix or new feature.
2. Make sure that all tests succeed.
3. If the merge request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
4. The pull request should work for Python latest 3.X.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

	 $ py.test test/test_morphofit.py
